/**
 * Golden match.
 *
 * A fixed four-way fight with a fixed seed, pinned to the exact hash stream it
 * produced when the simulation was declared correct. The self-consistency tests
 * next door prove the sim agrees with ITSELF; this one proves it still agrees
 * with its own past, which is what catches an accidental `Math.sin` or a
 * reordered phase in the tick loop.
 *
 * If this fails, the simulation changed. That is sometimes intentional — a
 * balance tweak, a new phase — in which case bump SIM_VERSION in world.ts and
 * regenerate the constants below. It is never something to "just update"
 * without knowing which change caused it, because a silent change here means
 * peers on different builds will desync mid-match.
